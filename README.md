# DocumentClassifier

Students face the challenge of managing a lot of files for academics, job applications, finances and various other files. 
The accumulation of these files at a single location results in chaos, making it challenging for students to locate specific documents when needed. 
Additionally, the sheer volume of files makes manually categorization a tedious task. Hence, we came up with this automation tool to help students save time organizing their files effortlessly.

This automation tool accesses your file directories, categorizing and organizing files into folders based on their content.

We utilized deep learning for image classification, training on approximately 15,000 images with diverse classification such as resumes, presentations, emails, letters and many more. 
We employed the Inception ResNet image classification model and combined Javascript, HTML, and python to develop a google chrome extension. 
This extension, once installed on the user's system, seamlessly accesses their local directory and categorizes files into folders.
